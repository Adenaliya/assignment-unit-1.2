# Assignment Unit 1 - Part 2

## Complete the Terminal Checkpoints

The videos this week introduced you to working with the command line through Terminal. Answer the questions below to check how much you learned.

In the `assignment` folder, you will find a `terminal.txt` file. This is just a plain old file of characters. No code, just text.

1. Open the `terminal.txt` file in VSCode. VSCode can open many kinds of files!
2. In the `terminal.txt`, answer all of the questions about the Terminal. All you need to do is type your answer below each question! 

> If you're unsure, feel free to do some research, or write that you're not sure. All we're asking for is you try your best! 

*When you're done, make a "`commit`" with `git`.*

## Submit Your Assignment in the Prime Portal

You will need to "submit" a link to your GitHub repo containing your work for this assignment. Prime will then use this link to find and check out your assignment! 

We won't know you're done until you [Submit it in the Portal](https://portal.primeacademy.io/).

You can find detailed instructions on how to do this in this week's video content.
